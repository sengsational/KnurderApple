# KnurderApple
SO71272885

After a 7 year run (and me paying $750) Knurder for Apple will no longer be updated.  By me anyway.  Apple requires new software versions in order to publish to the App Store, and my old iMac doesn't support the new software.  I'm not going to be coerced into buying new hardware for the privilege of giveing away the Knurder app.

If someone wants to fork the project and take over, you have my blessing.  Or if you want to send me or loan me a Mac with iOS 13.5 or later, I'd update Knurder.

I think we had more than 1000 active users at one point.  To all two users that expressed appreciation for the application, thank you.  To the (probably) hundreds that thought about expressing appreciation, thank you too.  Happy drinking, and I hope you can find your favorite beers directly with the Saucer's web site, and get them applied to your plate.
